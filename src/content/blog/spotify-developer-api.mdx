On the projects page, you can see what I'm currently listening to and what my top tracks are on Spotify. It was an interesting project to implement, helped by this blog <Anchor link="https://navidanindya.info/writing/spotify-now-playing-nuxt/" variant="link" />. Setting up the API, retrieving data via Postman requests, and then calling the Spotify API using fetch requests gave me good insight to OAuth.

## Create an app on the Spotify developer dashboard

I first needed to visit the <Anchor link="https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/" text="Spotify Developer Dashboard" variant="link" /> and log in with my Spotify credentials to create a new app.

This generated a `Client ID` and `Client Secret` which I saved somewhere safe. I set the redirect URI to the local version of my site, which was `http:localhost:3000`.

> 💡 When I later deployed the site later, I had to update the redirect URI to match the deployed site's URL.

## Get an auth code

To authorize my account, I needed to create a URL that logs into Spotify and grants permission to the required scopes. Here's what I needed to construct the URL:

- The `client_id`.
- The `redirect_uri`.
- The appropriate scopes for the information I wanted. I needed the current playing track and my top tracks, so I included all three scopes below.

```shell
https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=<MY_CLIENT_ID>&response_type=code&redirect_uri=<MY_REDIRECT_URI>&scope=user-read-currently-playing,user-read-playback-state,user-read-recently-played,user-top-read
```

After authorization, I was redirected back to my site with a code query parameter in the url. This code is needed to obtain a refresh token.

```shell
http://localhost:3000/callback?code=AQC7P..gBoDU..
```

## Get a refresh token

The `client_id:client_secret` combination needs to be encoded in Base64 format. I could have used a site like <Anchor link="https://www.base64encode.org/." variant="link" /> or print the result to the console:

```js
const encoded = Buffer.from(`${client_id}:${client_secret}`).toString("base64");
```

  alt="base64 of client id and client secret"

I used Postman for sending the requests. I set the endpoint, the headers and the body as x-www-form-urlencoded fields.

```shell
curl --location 'https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic <MY_BASE64_STRING>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
--data-urlencode 'code=<MY_REDIRECT_CODE>' \
--data-urlencode 'redirect_uri=<MY_REDIRECT_URI>'
```

The response from the endpoint has some fields but the important field I wanted was the `refresh_token`. This token doesn't expire, so I needed to keep it really safe.

## Get an access token

Obtaining the access token follows the same process as getting the refresh token. Isimply replaced the code with the `refresh_token`.

```shell
curl --location 'https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic <MY_BASE64_STRING>'Mzc5YjU=' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'refresh_token=<MY_REFRESH_TOKEN>' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=refresh_token'
```

The important field this time is the `access_token` which is used to retrieve my data and expires in one hour from the request time. Below is the JSON response returned from Postman.

```json
{
  "access_token": "BQBYmAESfVG4lfO0xe.......",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "scope": "user-read-playback-state user-read-currently-playing user-read-recently-played user-top-read"
}
```

## Get Spotify now playing

To get my currently playing track, I sent a GET request using the `access_token` I received.

```shell
curl --location 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/currently-playing' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <MY_ACCESS_TOKEN>'
```

The response from Spotify is a large JSON object with extensive information about the song. The key details I was interested in were the track title (item name) and the artist (an array).

```json
{
  "item": {
    "artists": [
      {
        "id": "48vDIufGC8ujPuBiTxY8dm",
        "name": "Palace",
        "type": "artist"
      }
    ],
    "explicit": false,
    "name": "Make You Proud"
  },
  "is_playing": true
}
```

## Get Spotify top tracks

To get the top tracks I've been listening to, I sent a GET request using the same `access_token` I received. There are two optional query parameters I've included. The long term `time_range` looks at listening history over the past year and the `limit` is set to return 5 items only.

```shell
GET: https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/top/tracks?time_range=long_term&limit=5

Headers: {
  Authorization: Bearer <Access_Token>
}

curl --location 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/top/tracks?time_range=long_term&limit=5' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <MY_ACCESS_TOKEN>'
```

And when all my scopes are set up correctly and my tokens are correct, Spotify returns with this response:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "album": {
        "artists": [
          {
            "name": "ANOTR"
          },
          {
            "name": "Abel Balder"
          }
        ],
        "name": "Relax My Eyes",
        "release_date": "2022-11-04"
      },
      "isExternal_urls": {
        "spotify": "https://open.spotify.com/track/5u4hhtZ7f4rWkMZEZcTKrH"
      },
      "name": "Relax My Eyes",
      "popularity": 78
    }
  ]
}
```

### Setting it all up

Once I had everything working in Postman, I could finally move my work over to my React site and show some data. Here is how the fetch request looked:

```js
// api/fetch-current-track.js

export const fetchCurrentTrack = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(
    "https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/currently-playing",
    {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer <MY_ACCESS_TOKEN>`,
      },
    }
  );

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error("Failed to fetch current track");
  }

  if (response.status === 204) {
    return { isPlaying: false };
  }

  const data = await response.json();
  return {
    isPlaying: data.is_playing,
    trackTitle: data.item.name,
    artist: data.item.artists.map((artist) => artist.name).join(", "),
    albumArtUrl: data.item.album.images[0].url,
    trackUrl: data.item.external_urls.spotify,
    preview: data.item.preview_url,
  };
};
```

To use this request, I needed to call `fetchCurrentTrack()` and display the data. I used TanStack Query since its super performant and easy to learn. Here's the final component that I added.

```js
export const CurrentPlay = () => {
  const currentTrack = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["currentTrack"],
    queryFn: fetchCurrentTrack,
    refetchInterval: 30000, // Refetch every 30 seconds
  });

  if (currentTrack?.isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  if (currentTrack.data) {
    return (
      <main>
        <h1>Now Playing:</h1>
        <div>
          <a href={trackData.trackUrl}>
            <h3>{data.trackTitle}</h3>
            <p>{data.artist}</p>
          </a>
        </div>
      </main>
    );
  }
};
```

### Going forward

I'm continuously improving this Spotify implementation and have added the following:

- a music preview that you can play and pause
- dynamic colours based on the album art
- showing most recently played if I'm not listening to anything right now

The options are endless.
