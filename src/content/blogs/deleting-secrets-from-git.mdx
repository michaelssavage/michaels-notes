Oops, I did it. I committed sensitive API data to my own Github. All good, I learned how to remove it. How did I remove the commits and fix this issue?

- First, change the API keys and passwords.
- For handiness, copy the offending file to a Notepad temporarily while you delete file.
- Use `git-filter-repo` to rewrite the history of commits.

## Guide

I used the <Anchor link="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository" text="Github Docs" variant="link" isExternal /> to help me through the process. I'm working on Windows, so I used pipx to install git-filter-repo:

```shell
pipx install git-filter-repo
```

The guide advises you to have a fresh clone of your project but I didn't have one so I force pushed the changes:

```shell
git-filter-repo --sensitive-data-removal --invert-paths --path "src/folder/TheAffectedFile.jsx"
```

After this, I had to sync my local project with my remote Github repository and push the changes:

```shell
git push --force --mirror origin
```


## Conclusion

This wipes the file from your history. Hooray! But if you didn't save it temporarily then you might have a bad time trying to recreate it from memory.
