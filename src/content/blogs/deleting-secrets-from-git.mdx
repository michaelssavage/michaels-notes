- First, change the API keys and passwords.
- For handiness, copy the offending file to a Notepad temporarily while you delete file.
- Use `git-filter-repo` to rewrite the history of commits.

## Guide

I used the <Anchor link="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository" text="Github Docs" variant="link" isExternal /> to help me through the process. I'm working on Windows, so I used pip to install git-filter-repo:

```shell
pip install git-filter-repo --user
```

The guide advises you to have a fresh clone of your project but I didn't have one so I force pushed the changes:

```shell
git filter-repo --invert-paths --path "src/folder/TheAffectedFile.jsx" --force
```

After this, I had to sync my local project with my remote Github repository:

```shell
git remote add origin https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git
```

Finally, I could push the changes and the commit would be wiped!

```shell
git push origin --force --all
```

## Conclusion

This wipes the file from your history. Hooray! But if you didn't save it temporarily then you might have a bad time trying to recreate it from memory.
