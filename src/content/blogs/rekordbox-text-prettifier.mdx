Edit (25th November 2024): I extended this small project and created a simple paste-and-copy webpage for more convenience. I just have to paste the text into a textarea and it will display the result immediately on the textarea beside it. View it here: <Anchor link="/blog/pretty-text" text="text prettifier" variant="link" />

I needed a small script that would format the text in a nicer way for me. I opted for Python and created a really simple executable to get a setlist from a .txt file from Rekordbox. The exe was created using pyinstaller, and proved to be a small and nifty utility that I would come back to now and again.

Rekordbox is a DJ software for preparing and managing your music library, recording and playing mixes, and loads of fancy AI-driven features.

The Python class gets the file to edit from user input, and formats the text file based on whether you want to include the song BPM or not.

The main work is handled in the updateContents file:

```python
def updateContents(self):
  try:
    fileInfo = open(self.filename, "r", encoding="utf-16").readlines()
    songInfo = fileInfo[0].strip().split("\t")
    artist = songInfo.index("Artist")
    track = songInfo.index("Track Title")
    bpm = songInfo.index("BPM")

    if self.choice:
        updated_content = self.withBPM(fileInfo[1:], artist, track, bpm)
    else:
        updated_content = self.noBPM(fileInfo[1:], artist, track)

    with open("_" + self.filename, "w", encoding="utf-16") as file:
        file.write(updated_content)
        print("File updated!")
```

I then looped through the file saving a nicer formatted list so that I could add the setlist to the SoundCloud mix description. Each track would like this:

```python
song = f"{i+1}. {songInfo[artist].strip()} - {songInfo[track].strip()}\n"
```
