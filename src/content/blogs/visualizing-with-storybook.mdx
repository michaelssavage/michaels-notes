I added storybook to my site. It's absolutely overkill for my personal corner of the internet but it is also my playground for testing things. And test things I will!

I have to say I like it! It gives me a clear visual of my main components at a glance. I can see the benefit of using it if I were in a team that was onboarding new people and encouraging backend-inclined members to code on the frontend. It would also be useful for interns and graduate developers to figure out how props change the appearance of components.

For the well-defined components, I created a folder to house the main component, the styled component, and the storybook file. For example:

```jsx
üìÅ Button
	üìÉ Button.stories.tsx
	üìÉ Button.styled.ts
	üìÉ Button.tsx
```

## The Deployment Dilemma

Originally, I wanted to deploy it as a subdomain at storybook.[michaelsavage.ie](http://michaelsavage.ie) but that would have added extra hosting costs. Instead, I configured the site to serve Storybook at `/storybook` inside the main site deployment.

Does it slow down my build? Yea‚Ä¶

Vite builds the app into `dist` , and storybook builds separately into `dist/storybook` so that the two outputs are deployed together. For now, Storybook is built on every deploy but eventually, I imagine I will move it to a separate Netlify site to speed things up and avoid bundling it unless I need it.

## Learning Curve

A lot of the heavy lifting was completed by Cursor in this regard even though the documentation is clear and concise. Time was definitely halved for the use case I wanted and after the second and third stories component, I started to see the pattern and I was able to adjust the styling to my needs.

It didn't take even half a day to get up and running. The Storybook command is very complete and thorough for getting you up and going with an example. All you need to run is:

```jsx
npm create storybook@latest
```

## Will I keep using it?

I think so. I'd like to implement this in a larger codebase that utilizes many components. Not everything needs a story though, and I'd like to have a better understanding how this workshop is not suited for all code. For example, it doesn't make sense to add it for very trivial wrappers, entire pages or routes, purely data-driven views, or Heads-up UI.

**Very trivial wrappers**  
	Components that do nothing more than wrap children to inject CSS or context, without any visible variation.

**Entire pages or routes**  
	Full-page layouts often depend on router context, global stores or data-fetching. They're harder to isolate and don't benefit as much from ‚Äúknobs.‚Äù

**Purely data-driven views**  
	If a component just renders JSON or a simple table with no UI states to experiment with, it's low ROI.

**Heads-up UI (toasts, alerts)**  
	Unless you want to play with timing, positions and interactions. If you never tweak those, leave them out.
