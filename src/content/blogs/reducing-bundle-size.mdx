I sat down and decided to tackle the huge bundle size of this site. Embarrassingly it was 23mb after building. I never looked into how to reduce it, but I knew that the problem would be the rendering of the blog posts. I have the bundle size now down to 1mb after tackling the biggest issues which is still considered a very large bundle size. I am aiming to get it down to 200kb - 500kb but here is the first things I did:

- I was processing all MDX files at build time. I was embedding all the blog post content directly into the JavaScript bundle but now I have moved the processing to Netlify Server functions so that the content is requested when needed.
- I removed some heavier packages like `masonic` and `@mdx-js/rollup` and updated some others packages so that they only lived in the dev dependencies. Also simply updating packages like `@tanstack/router-plugin` improved build output.

The build time for blog posts only extracts FrontMatter (metadata) content and now at runtime, I process the full MDX content on-demand when someone visits a post. The bundle size dropped by 90%.

I used `rollup-plugin-visualizer` to visualize the remaining output (view the below screenshot), and I could see that framer motion was taking up 25% of the build!!!

After a quick look around at alternatives I decided to replace <Anchor link="https://motion.dev/" text="framer-motion" variant="link" isExternal /> with <Anchor link="https://react-spring.dev/" text="react-spring" variant="link" isExternal />. Framer-motion is 2.9x larger than react-spring and again, and added no huge benefits over react-spring. I could view the sizes on bundlephobia.com for extra visual help:

- <Anchor link="https://bundlephobia.com/package/react-spring@10.0.1" variant="link" isExternal />
- <Anchor link="https://bundlephobia.com/package/framer-motion@12.23.11" variant="link" isExternal />

After replacing framer-motion, the bundle size dropped a significant amount. The full rendered amount comes out at 1mb, and gzipped at 332kb. React-spring takes up around 5% of the bundle size now so it will be the next target for reduction. Although Framer-motion wasn't the biggest offender, it was good to get an additional reduction in size. Overall, the 95% smaller size will lead to faster loading times, much less data consumed by visitors, and better performance on all devices.
