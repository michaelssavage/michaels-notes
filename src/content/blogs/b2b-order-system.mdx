It was one of the more difficult assignments I undertook in University, but the most rewarding. When I finally turned the corner and got to grips with React.js, I started to really enjoy frontend development. The learning curve was big and there was many stressful moments early on, but it has since allowed me to learn Next.js, make use of Typescript, and pick up other frameworks like Nuxt.js faster.

As well as the front, Python's Flask micro web framework was used for the backend. It dealt with concurrent read and write requests to a single CSV file. Users could create accounts and sign in, add to orders, and update the amount of stock left. The project aim was to highlight concurrency of requests, and how REST could deal with this.

Looking back at it now, it's a pretty small project that would take me a week to complete. But at the time it was a mammoth task. An important lesson that learning all the theory and best practices don't mean much until you apply them.
