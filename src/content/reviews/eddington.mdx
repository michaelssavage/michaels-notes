Ari Aster has done the job for me here. After the iffy <Anchor link="https://letterboxd.com/film/beau-is-afraid/" text="Beau Is Afraid" variant="link" isExternal /> that went over a lot of people's heads, including mine, this felt way stronger in its voice.

The screenplay really leans into all the intense feelings that Aster may have felt over the past five years, and you'll feel them too. Sadness, confusion, embarrassment, anger, rage, and whatever else pop ups when you self-reflect on all the ridiculousness.

Ari looks down each side of the political spectrum and takes a jab at everyone. Epidemic deniers that didn't want the Covid shot are given wry sympathy, they're the outcasts who voluntarily isolated themselves from society. We're then shown those that denounced genuine police brutality had leeches who were basically performatists, not really understanding or caring about what they were saying. And others that didn't care about government mandates, only thr optics surrounding their own image.

A commonly shared thought on the internet goes something like 'The Village Idiots were harmless members of society that said stupid shit, and we would say _"Ha, what a character!"_ But social media came along and each Village Idiot found each other and patted each other on the back.'

The Village Idiot in Eddington is the sheriff, Joe Cross played by Joaquin Phoenix, who writes '_Your_ being manipulated' on his truck and says 'Post it, don't let me think!'.

Eddington is a strange alien world to many, but it's grounded enough in the real world that everyone will be able to compare and characterize the people into figures in their life. With a wholly USA lens, there's no surprise that there are bits about Trump and his MAGA red hats, a recreation of Kyle Rittenhouse, and the BLM protests that spurred up. Misinformation, grifters, fake sources, and AI sycophancy is increasing the number of Village Idiots on the internet, and Eddington gives a dark humourous punch at this theme.

The mind-blowing, I mean **mind-blowing**, third act is surreal hyper-violence that ties a disgusting bloody bow on top of Aster's message, 'we are all fucked'... It is shocking and polarizing for viewers, with the film trying to shake the North American audience out of its slumber.
