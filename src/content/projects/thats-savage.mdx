## About

That's Savage specialise in high quality, custom print garments and logo design. With over 10 years experience in design and garment printing, there are no minimum order requirements meaning that we can print special one off garments while also catering for much larger orders.

This static site was a collaborative effort between me and my brother. We used React.js to build a simple site for hosting.

## Technologies Used

This site was a plain JavaScript React app bundled with Create-React-App, but has been refactored over time to use TypeScript and Vite. It used many different dependencies but these were cut down over time leading to the site being much more responsive and faster to set up.
