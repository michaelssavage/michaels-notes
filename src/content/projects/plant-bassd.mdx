## Technologies

<Anchor link="https://plantbassd.com" text="Plantbassd.com" variant="link" /> was created using <Anchor link="https://nextjs.org/" text="Next.js" variant="link" isExternal /> and TypeScript. In it's early days the app used JavaScript, CSS, and the blogs were written in markdown. But the site was constantly being refactored and I stored a list of 'to-dos' on Trello as I learned more about the technologies I was using.

The site gave me many mini victories and learning lessons over the three years I built it.

1. Adding TypeScript was essential and squashed a lot of bugs. I'd add it to any project I get my hands on.
2. The lack of flexibility in markdown was a major hindrance until I successfully added MDX. It worked well with <Anchor link="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter" text="gray-matter" variant="link" isExternal /> and marked, and allowed me to add JSX components into the blog posts.
3. Vercel, on the free tier, optimized images by using Webp and sped up my SSG app noticeably. But the limited allowance was creeping up very quickly and I had to take action. I moved all the images out of the repository into <Anchor link="https://cloudinary.com/" text="Cloudinary" variant="link" isExternal />, while still keeping the optimization in place. A key benefit to doing this was being able to swap images in and out without having to rebuild the whole Plant Bass'd site on Github.
4. Directory structure was not a fully thought out plan in the early days. I didn't know how long Plant Bass'd would be used for really, so being mindful of how it would expand over time wasn't planned well enough. After a certain while, it became too obvious to ignore and I had to sit down to reorganise the repository.
5. To get the ball rolling, the app was styled with Bootstrap 5 and CSS. I eventually swapped the styling for SCSS and have gained a large understanding of its benefits. It's more flexible, more readable, more reusable, and the use of mixins and functions are amazing!

Plant Bass'd has allowed me to access my 'creative side' by gaining an understanding in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. I created cover images for articles and tried to keep consistency in the colours and shapes used. I'm in no means a good graphic designer but I get a lot of satisfaction from making these images.

I also learned how to use Adobe Premiere Pro to create videos to display on the projectors at some of the events. By far the most time consuming hobby, I created a 20 minute video for a Valentine's themed party consisting of colourful and romantic movie snippets. I searched in close to 200 movies for clips ranging in 2 to 8 seconds long.
