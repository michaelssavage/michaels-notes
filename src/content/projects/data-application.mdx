In 2022, as a part of a team of three, I developed a full stack application for creating data products using React, Typescript, React Query, Spring Boot, and MongoDB. This project was a demo to replace an existing process that was undertaken through a complicated Excel sheet. We successfully allowed users to create data products through a smooth interface. As the user clicked through pages and gathered the requirements they specified, their results were stored using state management. As the state wasn't massive, we didn't need to use Redux, but instead opted for React's Context API.

In the end, we implemented secure token-based authentication and I was given the chance to lead on some frontend architecture and design decisions of the site. I used Photopea for wireframes, and learned to use Tanstack's React Query library. It was a hugely beneficial app for my development.
