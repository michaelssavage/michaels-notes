# What is Plant Bass’d?

In early 2020, Oisín Campbell, Peter Toal, and I, from Co. Monaghan, Ireland, came together to form Plant Bass'd. Initially, the collective's main focus was sharing our love for music and throwing parties. However, it soon developed into something bigger, with a mission to showcase artists, releases, and club nights in the experimental dance music world. Electronic music is not a major thing in our part of the world, especially Bass/ Drum/ LATAM music.

The team shares a common goal and passion, and we aspire to create unforgettable Plant Bass'd events across Ireland and the UK. Our roles have evolved over time with Oisín primarily hosting parties in Edinburgh and Glasgow while I look after the website, Soundcloud, and social media graphics. We write articles about various subjects and it has been immense in improving my writing skills. My favourite series that we contribute to is the Under The Radar monthly roundup, which takes a look at the newest releases from artists around the world. It's important to seek out and look for up-and-coming artists and not just rely on the heavily distorted Discover Weekly from Spotify.

Oisín has been a pioneering voice in Scotland with the shows he has put on, with more than 30 shows across Glasgow and Edinburgh providing a safe dance space for all. At the end of 2023, I threw my first party in Galway before adding another to my belt in early 2024. Throwing parties involves a lot of planning, with the wheels starting to turn months before the eventual date. You need to organise the DJs playing, the sound system, the venue, the social media campaign, the flyers! There's a lot, but the satisfaction of the big lights turning on at the end is unrivalled. It is always worth it.
